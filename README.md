From a design originaly from Mike Chi's VGA2SCART

# Atomiswave Multiout
Get Composite, RGB or S-Video output from your Atomiswave, using the VGA output


## Features:
- The motherboard is doing all the job, the "hat" or daughterboard is the one with the output connectors, so you can make one for your needs
- PAL/NTSC selection
- LP Filter
- Audio Line-in level is driven from the daughterboard, leaving the ability to keep pass-trought audio for amp already present inside a cabinet

## Notes:
- You'll need to program the CDCE either with using a DFO programmer or ask your ICs provider to do it for you.
- The connector to audio/power is tricky to find, I found some on eBay: https://www.ebay.ca/itm/184681041924
